# PH491-Hackathon01-Higgs-Boson-Classification
Classification of Higgs Boson-positive and Higgs Boson-negative events using kinematic properties of events. <br>
After trying various ensembled random tree methods including a bagging classifier and a voting classifier, and trying a simple neural network, the final selected model was an Adaboost ensemble with max_depth = 2 on the individual trees.
